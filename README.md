# Dog Image Gallery
This is a simple dog image gallery app. Class project by [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com).

The app contains the following:
- A gallery of random cute dog and puppy images via API
- Filter dog images by breed and number of images to view or by random
- Built using Python, Flask, Jinja, API

### See it in action!
Check out this [repl](https://repl.it/@adriculous/Dog-Image-Gallery) and feel free to play with it.

### Future Plans
I'll use this app as a base template for a fan art gallery of my favorite J-Pop groups and artists, fan art created by me and fellow fans.
